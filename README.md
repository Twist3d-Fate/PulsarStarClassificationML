# PulsarStarClassificationML
ML Project Classifying Pulsars in Dataset with Many Stellar Objects (Non-Pulsars)
 - Dataset featured ~18000 unique observations
 - Project includes many statistical plots and visualizations for data analysis
 - Randomized Search and Grid Search CVs for hyperparameter tuning
 - Comparison Between 6 Models (XGB, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM)
 - Used Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Accuracy, and AUC for train/test sets to evaluate Models
 - Overall, XGB performed best across all metrics in both train and test sets, except for test AUC where logistic regression performed best.
 - TODO: Add LBGM/Catboost to comparison, potentially other models and a stacking classifier
